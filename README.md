# EZBattery
An easy-to-use redox flow battery simulation software  
## Instructions
EZBattery is an easy-to-use flow battery simulation software for predicting the concentrations, potentials, and cycling performance of redox flow batteries (RFBs) and their variants. Its generalizability and accuracy have been verified for inorganic (all vanadium), organic (DHPS-Ferricyanide), hybrid (Zinc-Iodine), and redox-targeting (Fe-S) RFBs by comparing software simulation results with laboratory-scale experiments. This software demonstrates excellent computational efficiency of less than 0.1 s per charge-discharge cycle. In addition to its generalizability, high accuracy, and high efficiency, the software also supports various physical and operation setups, including a switch option between 0-dimension and 2-dimension scheme, a support for both unit cell and long duration energy storage system simulations, a support for constant current and time-varying power operations, and flexible for using different physicochemical parameters for electrode, electrolyte, current collector, pump, and operational conditions. The software is also user-friendly by using standard input and output formats, automated model calibration and validation, and flexible control on the start and stop operating time and state of charge. The work is supported by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s Energy Storage Materials Initiative and US DOE Office of Electricity’s Rapid Operational Validation Initiative.

## Installation
The following libraries are needed.  
* Python  
  Version 3.9 or newer are recommended.  
  It is highly recommended to install the python and the dependent packages through Conda. The user can find the anaconda package for various operation systems on https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads
* numpy (1.24.3)
* scipy (1.14.0)
* ismember (1.0.5)
* openpyxl (3.0.10)
  
Using different version of numpy and scipy as listed above may cause slightly different simualtion results.  

## Run the code
All the codes for the models are in folder EZBattery. Five Jupyter Notebooks are provided to demonstrate how to used the code. All the necessary data for the demos are in folder Data.
* Demo_Cell_Usage.ipynb : a demo to show the minimum requirement to run the model, with all vanadium flow battery as an example.
* Demo_Calibration_Vanadium.ipynb : simulate all vanadium redox flow battery.
